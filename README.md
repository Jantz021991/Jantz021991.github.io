#Simple WebPage Development Project

This project demonstrates a simple web development application with only two basic screens.

1. The first page is the Home page, the source code of which is written in sample.html. This screen is a basic home page which gives a brief description about me and has a simple styled picture of me.This picture is styled to be embedded within a circle.

2. The second page is the list of activities that I have been doing in my free time activities. The source code of this is given in FunActivity.html

All the pictures embedded within the application are in the folder Pics within the project.

It is a simple and easy! This is my First web Page that I have developed and it has been fun learning and coloring my web application.
